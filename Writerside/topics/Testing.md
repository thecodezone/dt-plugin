```
Use the port number sourced from step 4.

6. Once command has successfully completed, with no errors; run the tests with the following command:

./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

7. On a successful run, the following output should be shown:

```Bash
Time: 00:00.679, Memory: 14.00 MB
OK (39 tests, 64 assertions)
```
