## About the project
This plugin is a modern, opinionated plugin Framework for Disciple.Tools. It makes minimal use of third-party libraries and supports PHP 7.4 thought 8.3, 
and all while providing a modern  developer experience that will make Laravel and Symphony developers feel at-home.

### Purpose
At CodeZone, we recognize a developer or team might love Disciple.Tools, but miss the modern tooling found in PHP Application frameworks.

There growing community of Laravel and Symfony developers who bring exceptional expertise to the table.

Our purpose is to bridge the gap between these seasoned developers and the dynamic environment of Disciple.Tools. We strive to make Disciple.Tools plugin development not only accessible but also a delightful experience for those already well-versed in Laravel and Symfony frameworks.
